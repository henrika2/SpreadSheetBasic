# Comments to Evaluators:

The `DependencyGraphTests` class contains unit tests designed to thoroughly validate the functionality of the `DependencyGraph` class. Each test is intended to verify the correct behavior of the graph under various conditions, including edge cases and stress scenarios. 

Key test scenarios include verifying the correct size of the graph, ensuring proper functionality when adding and removing dependencies, and testing the behavior of dependency replacements. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the `DependencyGraph` class operates as expected and handles all specified operations accurately.

# Assignment Specific Topics:

The test project includes:
- Unit tests for each public method in the `DependencyGraph` class.
- Tests covering all input cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
- Performance tests to validate the correctness of the `DependencyGraph` class.

Each test is designed to cover different aspects of the `DependencyGraph` functionality and to ensure that all operations perform correctly and efficiently. Comments and assertions are included to provide clarity and to confirm that the expected behavior is achieved.
