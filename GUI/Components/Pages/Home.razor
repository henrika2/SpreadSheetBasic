            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Spreadsheet Application</strong> offers a user-friendly interface for managing cell data.
                It allows users to perform basic operations such as selecting, editing, clearing, saving, and loading spreadsheets.
                Additionally, the application ensures data integrity with features like unsaved change alerts.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="editing">
            <h2>Changing Selections and Editing Cells</h2>
            <p>
                To change the active cell, simply click on any cell in the grid. The selected cell will be highlighted,
                and its reference (e.g., A1, B2) will be displayed in the toolbar.
                To edit the contents, click the cell, enter a new value or formula in the "Contents" input field, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="file-management">
            <h2>File Management</h2>

            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Saving Your Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Click the "Save" button, enter a file name, and confirm to save your work.
                    Files are saved with a ".sprd" extension. If unsaved changes exist, a warning will prompt you before clearing or loading a new spreadsheet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Clearing the Spreadsheet</h3>
                <p>
                    To clear the spreadsheet, click the "Clear" button. This will delete all data, but it won’t function
                    if unsaved changes are present, ensuring you don’t lose data accidentally.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Loading a Spreadsheet</h3>
                <p>
                    To load a new spreadsheet, click the "Load" button and select a ".sprd" file. If the JSON in the file is invalid,
                    an error message will guide you. All current data will be removed before loading the new file.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="additional-features">
            <h2>Additional Features</h2>
            <p>
                The application includes two new features: <strong>Dark Mode/Light Mode</strong> and
                <strong>Direct Cell Editing</strong>. Users can switch between dark and light modes by clicking the
                "Switch to Dark Mode" or "Switch to Light Mode" button located in the toolbar. This adjusts the appearance
                of the spreadsheet to the user's preference, which is saved and persists even when the application is reloaded.
                Additionally, users can now change the value of a cell directly by double-clicking on the cell, entering the
                new value, and pressing <strong>Enter</strong> to save the change.
                This feature allows for a more intuitive and faster editing experience within the spreadsheet interface.
